# README Generator

Ninth week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a a README generator to quickly generate a professional README.md file for a new project. Our main tasks were to ensure that:

* When prompted for information about a new application repository, a high-quality README.md file is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests and Questions.

* When the project title is entered, it is displayed as the title of the README.

* When a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines and test instructions are entered, then this information is added to the sections of the README with those headers.

* The user is prompted to choose a license from a list, and when a license is chosen a badge for that license is added to to the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README titled License that explains which license was chosen.

* When a Github username is entered, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the user's Github profile.

* When an e-mail address is entered, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions with instructions on how to reach the user.

* When the user clicks on the links in the table of contents, then they are taken to the corresponding sections of the README.
